This is Q4 of the 2024 software recruitment questions for UBC AeroDesign.

Consider the 1-1010th Pokémon in the national pokedex without any forms/formes. Which three Pokémon have the highest product of its base attack stat and number of red pixels in its sprite image?

You can assume a pixel is red if it’s between the HSV values of `(0, 100, 20)` and `(10, 255, 255)` for low hues levels and and between the HSV values of `(160, 100, 20)` and `(179, 255, 255)` for high hues levels. In your answer, name the top three scoring Pokémon, their “red attack” power, and briefly explain how you solved the problem. To ensure consistency in sprite images, use the zip folder with sprite images in this repo. Link any code you write for this question as a GitHub gist.
